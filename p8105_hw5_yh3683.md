# Problem 1

Check if at least two people share a birthday

``` r
birthday_simulation <- function(n) {
  birthdays <- sample(1:365, n, replace = TRUE) 
  return(any(duplicated(birthdays))) 
}
```

Run 10,000 simulations for group sizes 2-50, calculate shared birthday
probability for each size, and plot the probabilities against group
sizes.
![](p8105_hw5_yh3683_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)<!-- --> The
plot shows that the probability of at least two people sharing a
birthday increases rapidly with group size, surpassing 50% at around 23
people, demonstrating the Birthday Paradox.

The plot demonstrates a positive relationship between effect size (μ)
and statistical power. At small μ values, the test has low power and
often fails to detect true effects. As μ increases, power rises rapidly
and approaches 100%, indicating the test becomes increasingly effective
at detecting larger effects.

    ## 
    ## | True μ|Power  |
    ## |------:|:------|
    ## |      0|5.2%   |
    ## |      1|18.2%  |
    ## |      2|56.2%  |
    ## |      3|89.0%  |
    ## |      4|98.8%  |
    ## |      5|100.0% |
    ## |      6|100.0% |

plot shows that the average estimate of μ for all samples (blue) follows
the true value of μ, while the average estimate for only those samples
where the null was rejected (red) is consistently higher, particularly
for small effect sizes. This phenomenon, known as selection bias, occurs
because rejected samples are more likely to have estimates farther from
zero, leading to an upward bias in the average estimate for rejected
tests.
