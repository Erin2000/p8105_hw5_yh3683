# Problem 1

Check if at least two people share a birthday

``` r
birthday_simulation <- function(n) {
  birthdays <- sample(1:365, n, replace = TRUE) 
  return(any(duplicated(birthdays))) 
}
```

Run 10,000 simulations for group sizes 2-50, calculate shared birthday
probability for each size, and plot the probabilities against group
sizes.
![](p8105_hw5_yh3683_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)<!-- --> The
plot shows that the probability of at least two people sharing a
birthday increases rapidly with group size, surpassing 50% at around 23
people, demonstrating the Birthday Paradox.
